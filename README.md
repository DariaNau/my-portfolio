https://darianau.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/index.html

## Description

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

### Instructions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:


Create the following pages: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.


Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:


1. A navbar


2. A responsive layout


3. Responsive images

The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

#### Hints


Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.


#### Minimum Requirements


Functional, deployed application

GitHub repository with README describing the project


#### Bonus

Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
